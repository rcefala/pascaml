A pascal interpreter written in OCaml
=====

A simple Pascal interpreter written in OCaml started as a Final Project for the Functional Programming course at the University of Perugia (Italy).

It implements just a subset of the PASCAL language and its main purpose is training in Functional Programming (or better, OCaml). Everyone is invited to take the code and add the features they like. There is still lot of stuff that could be added to have a 'complete' interpreter.

## What it Features:
  * Expression Handling
  * Variables (Real and Integer)
  * `While` and `If` statements
  * Procedures

## What it Lacks:
  * A proper type checking mechanism
  * A proper parsing error handling
  * All other statements
  * Functions
  * Types Definition
